In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, aiming to boost financial inclusion, investment, and economic growth. But has it worked?
My research, conducted during the Multidisciplinary Seminar on International Studies at the Carlos III University of Madrid, analyses the real impact of Bitcoin by assessing key economic indicators: unemployment, GDP per capita, remittances, financial inclusion and inflation.
🔍 Findings
📉 Unemployment fell, possibly due to new tech jobs.
🏦 Financial inclusion remains low, with minimal increases in banking participation.
📈 GDP per capita continues to rise, though not necessarily due to Bitcoin.
💸 Remittances haven’t shifted significantly to Bitcoin transactions.
📊 Bitcoin’s volatility limits its role as a stable currency.
💡 Recommendations:
✅ Financial education to boost adoption.
✅ Better infrastructure for digital access.
✅ Stronger safeguards to manage Bitcoin’s risks.
🌎 Global Relevance:
El Salvador’s experience serves as a critical case study for other nations considering Bitcoin adoption. While the move has positioned the country as a leader in cryptocurrency adoption, the long-term economic and social impacts remain uncertain. My analysis suggests that while Bitcoin presents opportunities, caution and strategic adjustments are essential for success.
🚀 This research contributes to the global dialogue on cryptocurrencies, financial inclusion, and digital economies.
